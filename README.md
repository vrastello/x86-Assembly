This project uses primitive string intructions and macros to implement procedures in x86 Assembly without the help of additional libraries.
The program manually reads user input as a string and converts to signed integer, then saves number in array. It validates if the 
number is too large to fit in a 32 bit register and if characters are sign and digits 0-9 only. Once 10 numbers are retrieved 
from user it calculates the average and sum. It then converts the numbers from signed integer to string and prints out the array, sum and average.
